<p>For this tekken guide I will be using Hwoarang as a way to provide an example of tekken 8's combo system. Hwoarang has some of the highest damage in the game. Below is a video example of this.</p>
<br>

<br>
<p>As you can see in the above video, tekken 8 has a lot of new system mechanics to play with. You will notice that I can extend the combo using heat burst, similar to an instal but universal to the whole cast.<br> In this state (which is limited and tied to a bar under the health bar) you have access to a mechanic called heat dash and heat smash. This is what I used to get the opposing player to the wall. After this happens you will<br>further notice that the wall, which is glowing red, is caused to explode, leading to further combo damage. This is a far cry from the systems present in tekken 7.</p>

<br>
<p>As you can see, the difference in what is possible is quite polarizing. When learning Tekken 8 it is important to take time to learn the new systems as best you can. While Tekken 8 boasts easier base <br>mechanics such as moving, it brings a lot of new depth to the table for anyone looking to really sink their teeth in.
